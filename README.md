# **NEW VIEW**

**Project ID: 01**
>## **Project Mentor: Omkar Agarwal, Garima Singh**

>## ✍&nbsp; PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Many times, I want to watch a movie so I google whether the movie/season is available on my streaming service Netflix/Amazon video. So a central directory where I could search it and maybe even set notification about when it will be available. That would be awesome.

>## 📂&nbsp; RELEVANT TECHNOLOGY
Any web technology can be used but I am thinking about using NodeJS ecosystem.

* Any FrontEnd framework (Angular/React/Vue)
* NodeJS
* MySQL/MongoDB/Firebase
